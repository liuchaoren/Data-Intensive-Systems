In this demo, we want to find the players who have performed better than a specific player X in some aspects. Like in this example, the aspect we have interest in is "b_at_bats" and the player X's player ID is "rolliji01". When evaluating the scores, we calculate the averages in three-year time slots. For example, if player X played from 2000 to 2006, we have to calculate his average scores in [2000,2002], [2001,2003], [2002,2004], [2003,2005], [2004, 2006] and return his highest score. The players who have reached higer scores will also be provided, with detailed information about the scores and in which three-year slots they have achieved these scores.
